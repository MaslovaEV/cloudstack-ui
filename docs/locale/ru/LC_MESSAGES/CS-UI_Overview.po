"CloudStack-UI is a project which purpose is to provide an easy-to-use, "
"light, and user-friendly front-end interface for the Apache CloudStack "
"virtualization management system."

"Apache CloudStack is a great product which is widely used. But its front "
"end is developed for administrators (from our point of view), not for "
"cloud end-users. Some of the interactions are not straightforward and "
"unnatural to an average user and require quite a long time to adapt. "
"Other reasons to develop the UI are connected to the lack of functions "
"like virtual machine statistics & charting, sophisticated resource "
"accounting, and application management."

"That is what we are trying to add to Cloudstack-UI. The work is still in "
"progress. But for now we have already covered lots of features that make "
"CloudStack more good-looking, intuitive and convenient."

"At `Bitworks Software <https://bitworks.software/en>`_, we have been "
"running an ACS public cloud for 3 years (actually we still run CS 4.3 "
"cloud in production). And we have found that average users who are "
"familiar with Digital Ocean, Amazon AWS, and other VPS management systems"
" feel uncomfortable with original CloudStack UI and make a lot of "
"operational mistakes. That is why we have decided to implement a "
"convenient and neat end-user facing UI covering regular activities, which"
" are important for day-to-day VM management."

msgid "There are several aims we strived to achieve with the new UI:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CS-UI_Overview.rst:24
msgid ""
"The first goal is to make the UI more intuitive in terms of usability, "
"business processes and typical use-cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CS-UI_Overview.rst:26
msgid ""
"As nowadays people move further from desktop PCs and go full mobile, we "
"wanted the UI to have a support for that. Having a full control of your "
"cloud from a smartphone, what could be better?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../CS-UI_Overview.rst:28
msgid ""
"One of the major goals we want to achieve is to build a UI that is "
"possible to support for many years. Thatâ€™s why we have to use only modern"
" technologies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CS-UI_Overview.rst:30
msgid ""
"From the technical perspective we also want the UI to support additional "
"meta-information like descriptions, colors, groups, helpers. All of that "
"is not supported by the native UI and it could be used to add some "
"additional semantics to the entities that user has: like Vms, snapshots "
"and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CS-UI_Overview.rst:32
msgid ""
"The next key point that we wanted to cover with the new UI is to have "
"some extra features beyond the functionality that CloudStack provides, "
"e.g. DNS management, helpdesk integration, PaaS management, runtime "
"statistics charts and monitoring."
msgstr ""

#: ../../CS-UI_Overview.rst:34
msgid ""
"And a final goal is to have a community support that could help us to "
"improve the product and provide better user experience for the CloudStack"
" users."
