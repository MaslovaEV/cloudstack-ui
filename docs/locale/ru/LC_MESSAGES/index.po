"CloudStack-UI is a project which purpose is to provide an easy-to-use, "
"light, and user friendly frontend interface for the Apache CloudStack "
"virtualization management system."

"Apache CloudStack is a great product which is widely used. But its "
"frontend is developed for administrators (from our point of view), not "
"for cloud end users. Some of the interactions are not straightforward and"
" unnatural to an average user and require quite a long time to adapt. "
"Other reasons to develop the UI are connected with lack of functions like"
" virtual machine statistics & charting, sophisticated resource "
"accounting, and application management."

"That's what we are trying to add to Cloudstack-UI. The work is still in "
"progress. But for now we have already covered lots of features that make "
"CloudStack more good-looking and intuitive."
