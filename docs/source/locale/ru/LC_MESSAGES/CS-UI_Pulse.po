"The Pulse plugin is designed for visualization of virtual machines "
"performance statistics. Currently, this CloudStack-UI extension is only "
"compatible with ACS clusters that use the KVM hypervisor. With help of "
"sensors that collect virtual machines performance statistics via the "
"Libvirt API and store them in an InfluxDB datastore and RESTful "
"statistics server, CloudStack-UI is able to display CPU, RAM, disk IO and"
" network traffic utilization in the form of convenient visual charts."
