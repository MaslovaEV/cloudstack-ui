"Just specify the WebShell endpoint when you run the UI container. You can"

"WebShell is a CloudStack-UI extension designed to perform a clientless "
"SSH connection to a virtual machine. The extension is activated in the "
"CloudStack-UI configuration file and is supported by an additional Docker"
" container. As for the way of WebShell usage, the plugin is similar to "
"NoVNC interface provided by CloudStack. However, WebShell uses the SSH "
"protocol and does not allow VM emergency management."
