This container is a standalone shell proxy and can be used outside of the CloudStack UI, but there is an option to integrate them, Just specify the WebShell endpoint when you run the UI container. You can also disable the plugin in the UI configuration anytime you want."

msgid "WebShell is a CloudStack-UI extension designed to perform a clientless SSH connection to a virtual machine. The extension is activated in the CloudStack-UI configuration file and is supported by an additional Docker container. As for the way of WebShell usage, the plugin is similar to NoVNC interface provided by CloudStack. However, WebShell uses the SSH protocol and does not allow VM emergency management."
